:description: Groovy 2.5.1 Release Announcement.

Dear community,

image:img/groovy_logo.png[Groovy logo,200,float="right"]
The Apache Groovy team is pleased to announce version 2.5.1 of Apache Groovy. Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted programming language for the JVM. Further details can be found at the http://groovy.apache.org website.

For this release we focused on fixing up some of the usability/packaging issues that the 2.5.0 release introduced as part of supporting Groovy across JDKs 7 through (soon) 11. Maven/Gradle users not needing JAXB should now have a much improved experience building with the new version. (SUREFIRE users should read the release notes about some caveats). In 2.5.2, we should have additional changes to improve the build experience even further for JAXB users and users of the Groovy command-line tools. Please read the release notes for further information: http://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-2.5.html#Groovy2.5releasenotes-Addendum251

This release is a maintenance release of the GROOVY_2_5_X branch. It is strongly encouraged that all users using prior versions on this branch upgrade to this version.

This release includes 44 bug fixes/improvements as outlined in the changelog:

Sources, convenience binaries, downloadable documentation and an SDK bundle can be found at: http://www.groovy-lang.org/download.html We recommend you verify your installation using the information on that page.

Jars are also available within the major binary repositories.

We welcome your help and feedback and in particular want to thank everyone who contributed to this release.

Best regards,

The Apache Groovy team.
