<p>
The <a href="http://groovy.apache.org/">Apache Groovy</a> team congratulates long-time Groovy committer Graeme Rocher on receiving his Groundbreaker award at Oracle Code One.
Graeme has made numerous significant contributions to Apache Groovy and has also founded two of the most important frameworks using Groovy: <a href="https://grails.org/">Grails</a> and <a href="http://micronaut.io/">Micronaut</a>. </p> <img height="600" width="800" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DqPOTAPU0AAK_5d.jpg" /> 
  <p>&quot;<em>Grails pioneered truly rapid web application development on the JVM, helping to drive the adoption of the Groovy language which today has such an inclusive community and phenomemal ecosystem</em>&quot;.&nbsp;</p>
