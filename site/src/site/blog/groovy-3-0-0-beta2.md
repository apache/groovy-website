The Windows installer for Groovy 3.0.0-beta-2 is now available from Bintray: <a href="https://bintray.com/groovy/Distributions/download_file?file_path=groovy-3.0.0-beta-2-installer.exe">https://bintray.com/groovy/Distributions/download_file?file_path=groovy-3.0.0-beta-2-installer.exe</a>.

<p>
I've again included a preview of an msi built with WiX, which I'm seeking feedback on: 
<a href="https://bintray.com/groovy/Distributions/download_file?file_path=groovy-3.0.0-beta-2+%28preview+installer%29.msi">https://bintray.com/groovy/Distributions/download_file?file_path=groovy-3.0.0-beta-2+%28preview+installer%29.msi</a>

<p>
Be aware that you need to fully uninstall the NSIS based Groovy installation before installing with an MSI installer.
