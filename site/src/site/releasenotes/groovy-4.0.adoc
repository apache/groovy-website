a| NOTE: _WARNING:_
Material on this page is still under development! We are currently releasing alpha versions of Groovy 4.0 with a goal
of gathering feedback on the language changes from our community. In addition, the beta versions assist other projects
and tool vendors within the Groovy ecosystem to begin assessing the impact of moving to/supporting Groovy 4.0.
Caution should be exercised if using new features as the details may change before final release.
|===

[[Groovy4.0old-parser]]
== Old parser removal

In Groovy 4.0, the old Antlr2 based parser is removed. Please use Groovy versions up to 3.x if you require the old parser.

[[Groovy4.0indy]]
== Classic bytecode generation removal

For many versions, Groovy could generate classic _call-site based_ bytecode
or bytecode targetting the JDK7+ invoke dynamic ("indy") bytecodes.
In Groovy 4.0, only bytecode using the latter approach can be generated.
Consequently, there are no longer any "-indy" jars.

Currently, the Groovy runtime still contains any necessary support for
classes compiled using older versions of Groovy.
Please use Groovy versions up to 3.x if you need to generate old bytecode.

[[Groovy4.0maven-coordinates]]
== Maven coordinates

In Groovy 4.0, the _groupId_ of the maven coordinates for Groovy have changed from `org.codehaus.groovy`
to `org.apache.groovy`. Please update your Gradle/Maven/other build settings appropriately.

[[Groovy4.0other]]
== Other improvements

=== JavaShell (incubating)

A Java equivalent of GroovyShell, allowing to more easily work with snippets of Java code.

=== JSR308 improvements (work in progress)

Groovy has been improving JSR-308 support over recent versions.
In Groovy 4.0, additional support has been added.

=== Java-inspired changes (under investigation)

The following changes are being explored:

* Switch expressions
* Module definitions written in Groovy
* Support for records

== JDK requirements

Groovy 4.0 requires JDK9+ to build and JDK8 is the minimum version of the JRE that we support.
