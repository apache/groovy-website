With this new 2.1 release, Groovy:

* has *full support for the JDK 7 `invoke dynamic`* instruction and
API,
* goes beyond conventional static type checking capabilities with a
*special annotation for closure delegate based Domain-Specific
Languages* and *static type checker extensions*,
* provides *additional compilation customization* options,
* and features a *meta-annotation facility* for combining annotations
elegantly.

[[Groovy21releasenotes-Fullinvokedynamicsupport]]
== Full invoke dynamic support

With Groovy 2.0, we introduced support for JDK 7’s `invoke dynamic`
bytecode instruction and API to benefit from the dedicated support and
performance improvements for dynamic languages starting with JDK
7. Groovy 2.1 brings *full support for `invokedynamic`* (aka
`indy`), completing the work introduced in 2.0. 

In Groovy 2.0, most method calls were using the `invokedynamic`
instruction, but there have been exceptions: constructor calls
or "spread calls" (where you pass arguments with the "spread
operator"). Groovy 2.1 completes the implementation started in 2.0.
Now, code compiled with the `invokedynamic` JAR on JDK 7 will not be
using the old "call site caching" code which served us well for
getting good performance for Groovy prior to JDK 7. If you are lucky
enough to be using JDK 7 in production, be sure to use the Groovy 2.1
`indy` JAR to benefit from the full `invokedynamic` support. The
`indy` version is bundled with the binary download package and can be
obtained via Maven (all JARs with `invokedynamic` support are
postfixed with `-indy`).

You can link:../indy.html[learn more about the invoke dynamic support].

[[Groovy21releasenotes-DelegatesToannotation]]
== @DelegatesTo annotation

Authoring Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) has always been a sweet spot
for Groovy, and the availability of closures and the malleable syntax of
the language has allowed DSL implementors to build nice mini-languages
like "builders", to represent configuration or hierarchical data.

Thanks to the various delegation strategies of
the `groovy.lang.Closure` class, a range of very powerful techniques can
be used when building DSLs. Due to different implementation techniques,
inferring type information within the DSL has not been straightforward.
This is especially an issue when DSLs should have proper IDE support
(e.g. code completion).

The very popular and powerful link:http://www.gradle.org[Gradle] build
automation system uses its own DSL for build script specifications. On
the DSL implementation layer are various methods taking closures as
arguments, and with special delegation strategies delegating to some
other parameter passed to them. Providing good IDE support for Groovy
DSLs — like the one in Gradle — has presented a few challenges. Hence
the need for the `@DelegatesTo` annotation.

Groovy 2.1 introduces the *`@groovy.lang.DelegatesTo` annotation* as
a *documentation mechanism* for DSL users and maintainers, as an *IDE
hint for providing better coding assistance*, and as additional
information that can be *taken into account by the static type checker
and static compilation* introduced in Groovy 2.0. Let’s see that in
action with some examples.

A closure delegate based method usage might look like the following:

[source,groovy]
------------
exec {
    launch()
}
------------

The `exec()` method takes a closure as parameter, and the
actual `launch()` call inside that closure is delegated to some
particular object (the closure delegate), instead of being dispatched to
the enclosing class. The above code would only fail at runtime (not at
compile-time!), as the `launch()` method can not be found in the closure
context. In order to delegate method calls within the closure’s code
block to another object instance, we need to set the closure delegate.

Setting a closure delegate is as easy as
invoking `Closure#setDelegate(Object)`: 

[source,groovy]
-------------------------------
void exec(Closure c) {
    c.delegate = new Executor()
    c()
}
-------------------------------

The delegate can be set to an arbitrary object instance (here, an
instance of an `Executor` class that has a `launch()` method). When the
delegate is set accordingly, we can execute the closure code.

Note that usually, to avoid odd behavior if the closure is used in
multiple threads, we tend to clone that closure.

The problem with delegate objects are IDEs not knowing about them. Given
our example, most IDEs will underline the `launch()` method as being an
unknown method in this context.

This is where `@DelegatesTo` comes into play. By adding
the `@DelegatesTo` annotation to DSL methods like `exec(Closure)`, IDEs
get the actual delegate type and other meta-data.

A future update might let GroovyDoc show the details about the
annotation usage to help users know what methods they can call, what
properties they can access, etc.

Here’s what your `exec()` method will look like with the annotation:

[source,groovy]
---------------------------------------------
void exec(@DelegatesTo(Executor) Closure c) {
    c.delegate = new Executor()
    c()
}
---------------------------------------------

Besides specifying the actual delegate type, `@DelegatesTo`  can be used
to hint at the actual resolve strategy. The resolve strategy determines
the order in which non-closure method / property calls are looked up. In
our example, `Closure.DELEGATE_FIRST` will be used. This indicates the
closure will attempt to resolve against the given delegate object in
first place, followed by the owner object:

[source,groovy]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
import static groovy.lang.Closure.*
// ...
void exec(@DelegatesTo(strategy = DELEGATE_FIRST, value = Executor) Closure c) {
    c.delegate = new Executor()
    c.resolveStrategy = DELEGATE_FIRST
    c()
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IDE support is not the only reason to use `@DelegatesTo`. The *static
type checker and static compiler take the additional meta-data specified
by the @DelegatesTo annotation into account*. If there is a typo in the
closure code block, the type checker will complain. And if you use the
static compilation capability introduced in Groovy 2.0, the calls will
be compiled statically.

Let’s say we wouldn’t call `launch()` but `launchr()` in the closure
code block, we would get a message like:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Static type checking] - Cannot find matching method DelegatesToSamples#launchr().
Please check if the declared type is right and if the method exists.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Static type checks for custom Domain-Specific Languages* is a very
convenient feature in Groovy 2.1!

In addition, Groovy 2.1 features other abilities for even further type
checking your DSLs, as you shall see in the following section.

Before moving on, let’s mention a few closing details
about `@DelegatesTo`.

`@DelegatesTo` allows to specify the receiver calls are delegated to.
For instance, when a delegate calls a method or property on another
method parameter. Imagine our `exec()` method taking
the `Executor` argument instance as delegate:

[source,groovy]
----------------------------------------------------------
void exec(Executor ex, @DelegatesTo(Executor) Closure c) {
    c.delegate = ex
    c()
}
----------------------------------------------------------

In this example, the information is lost that the call is delegated to
the `ex` parameter. Thanks to the `@DelegatesTo.Target` annotation we
can specify ex as target for being the delegate object:

[source,groovy]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
void exec(@DelegatesTo.Target Executor ex, @DelegatesTo Closure c) {
    c.delegate = ex
    c()
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------

What if we had several `Executor` parameters, how would we differentiate
which one we’re targeting?

[source,groovy]
------------------------------------------------------
void exec(
    @DelegatesTo.Target('param1') Executor ex,
    @DelegatesTo(target = 'param1') Closure c) { ... }
------------------------------------------------------

The delegation "target" can be specified with an arbitrary id. In the
example above it is `param1`.

One last very nice little feature: if you are using static type
checking, you can omit the type of the parameter
and `@DelegatesTo` combined with "flow typing" (the ability of
following the current type of an untyped variable) would still know if
method calls are valid:

[source,groovy]
-----------------------------------------------------------
void exec(@DelegatesTo.Target ex, @DelegatesTo Closure c) {
    c.delegate = ex
    c()
}

class Executor {
    void launch() {}
}

def ex = new Executor()

exec(ex) {
    launch()
}
-----------------------------------------------------------

We’ve seen that the `@DelegatesTo` helps documenting, tooling, and
checking Domain-Specific Languages in the specific context of closure
delegate based methods, but we hinted at the fact we can go beyond, in
terms of static type checking for your DSLs.

For more details take a look at
the link:{DOCS_BASEURL}/html/documentation/#__code_delegatesto_code[@DelegatesTo documentation].

[[Groovy21releasenotes-Typecheckerextensions]]
== Type checker extensions

Static type checking was introduced in Groovy 2.0, but Groovy 2.1 goes
beyond built-in type checks and offers a way to *create type checker
extensions*. This is great news for Groovy scripts, configuration files,
or Domain-Specific Languages implementations as they can can be "type
checked" with more advanced, domain-specific rules. As an example, it
would be possible to create a custom DSL type checker that throws
compilation errors when certain verbs of the DSL are not recognized, or
tells this other noun is allowed even if it’s a dynamic name bound at
runtime, or type checks literal strings containing SQL code to see if
the syntax is correct, and more.

Imagine a script, where we define a small robot class and instantiate
it:

[source,groovy]
----------------------------------------------------
class Robot {
    void move(String dist) { println "Moved $dist" }
}

robot = new Robot()
----------------------------------------------------

And we want to operate our robot in the `operate()` method, but we want
this method to be type checked:

[source,groovy]
-----------------------------
@groovy.transform.TypeChecked
void operate() {
    robot.move "left"
}

operate()
-----------------------------

The static type checker will complain as it doesn’t understand where the
`robot` variable is coming from, as it’s going through the binding of
the script — note that we could teach the type checker to figure out
binding-bound variables. It will throw an error telling us that
the robot variable was undeclared.

But by utilizing type checker extensions, we can hook into the type
checking process to teach it how to handle unresolved variables! In
order to do that, we’ll specify an extension script through the newly
introduced `extensions` annotation parameter of
the `@TypeChecked` annotation:

[source,groovy]
---------------------------------------------
@TypeChecked(extensions = 'RobotMove.groovy')
void operate() {
    robot.move "left"
}
---------------------------------------------

Now it’s time to define the type checker extension script
called `RobotMove.groovy`. The type checker extension script is written
by applying a new DSL — the "type checking DSL". The DSL provides
various hooks for type checker extensions to register to. Going back to
the example above, we register for unresolved variables using
the `unresolvedVariable` hook:

[source,groovy]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
unresolvedVariable { VariableExpression var ->
    if ('robot' == var.name) {
        def robotClass = context.source.AST.classes.find { it.name == 'Robot' }
        storeType(var, robotClass)
        handled = true
    }
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The type checker extension script needs to be on the classpath. If this
is the case, the script gets notified during compile-time when the
static type checker encounters an unresolved variable. The unresolved
variable closure is handed over a `VariableExpression`.

The `VariableExpression` is an object directly from Groovy’s AST
(Abstract Syntax Tree). It is a representation of the unresolved
variable expression. The script checks if the variable is named `robot`,
if this is the case, we lookup a `ClassNode` representing
the `Robot` class, and store the type of that variable back in the AST.
At the end, the `handled` property is set to true, to indicate the type
checker already managed that variable. As a consequence, you won’t get
the compilation error about that undeclared variable.

To continue the journey, let’s consider the case where the user enters a
wrong direction string. We could of course use an enum or some other
class containing direction constants, but for the sake of the example,
we’ll have a look at how we can teach the type checker to inspect
strings and how you can actually throw your own compilation errors.

For that purpose, let’s say a robot can only move left, right, forward
and backward. And now, let’s change our robot move instruction to:

[source,groovy]
---------------------
robot.move "sideways"
---------------------

The robot is not allowed to move sideways, so we should instruct the
type checker to throw a compilation error if it encounters a direction
the robot will not be able to understand. Here’s how we can achieve our
goal, by adding a new event handler to our `RobotMove.groovy` script:

[source,groovy]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
afterMethodCall { MethodCall mc ->
    def method = getTargetMethod(mc)
    if (mc.objectExpression.name == 'robot' && method.name == 'move') {
        def args = getArguments(mc)
        if (args && isConstantExpression(args[0]) && args[0].value instanceof String) {
            def content = args[0].text
            if (!(content in ['left', 'right', 'backward', 'forward'])) {
                addStaticTypeError("'${content}' is not a valid direction", args[0])
            }
        }
    }
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This handler receives a `MethodCall` expression. We are using
the `getTargetMethod()` utility method to retrieve the
corresponding `MethodNode`. We check that the method call is a call to
our `robot`, and that the name of the method corresponds to
themove method. Then, we fetch the arguments passed to that method call,
and if we’re passed a direction in the form of a string constant, we are
checking that the direction is an actual allowed direction. If this is
not the case, we are adding a new static typing compilation error into
the mix, so that the compiler will yell at the poor user because he used
a direction which is forbidden and not understood by our robot.

This second example is also interesting in a way that it shows how you
can even add compilation checks on things like literal strings on a
domain-specific level, paving the way for possible checks on sprintf
strings, on SQL or HQL code in strings, etc, allowing you to go even
further that what the Java compiler actually checks.

The extension script can make use of various event oriented extension
points and utility methods coming from the `TypeCheckingExtension` class
from Groovy, such as:

* unresolvedVariable
* unresolvedProperty
* unresolvedAttribute
* methodNotFound
* incompatibleAssignment
* beforeVisitMethod
* afterVisitMethod
* beforeVisitClass
* afterVisitClass
* beforeMethodCall
* afterMethodCall
* onMethodSelection
* setup
* finish

The two examples are just the tip of the iceberg, but we will work out
more complete documentation of the various extension points and utility
methods going forward.

For more details take a look at
the link:http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/type-checking-extensions.html[type checking extensions documentation].

[[Groovy21releasenotes-Compile-time-Meta-annotations]]
== Compile-time Meta-annotations

Annotations are a great way to add supplementary meta-data to classes,
methods, fields, and other source code elements, thus frameworks,
libraries, and even Groovy’s homegrown AST transformations can take
advantage of them to do some special treatments to the corresponding AST
nodes. Every now and then the use case arises to reuse a combination of
annotations, potentially at the expense of a galore of at-signs that
obscure the general intent of that particular combination.

To group annotations together, to make the intent clearer or to
streamline your code, Groovy 2.1 offers a *meta-annotation system, which
allows to combine other annotations into one "alias" annotation*.

Imagine we are using some annotations defining constraints on properties
of your class, like `@NotNull`, `@Length`, or `@Pattern`, which could be
defined as follows:

[source,groovy]
-------------------------------
@interface NotNull {}

@interface Length {
    int value() default 0
}

@interface Pattern {
    String value() default ".*"
}
-------------------------------

An example of how to annotate an `ISBN` property with those annotations
could look like this:

[source,groovy]
---------------------------
class Book {
    @NotNull
    @Length(10)
    @Pattern(/\d{9}(\d|X)/)
    String isbn10
}
---------------------------

For a single property, that’s quite a bit of annotation overload! And it
could be the case of other domain classes with properties having the
same validation rules as the ISBN property, where we would need to
duplicate that pattern.

As of Groovy 2.1, `@groovy.transform.AnnotationCollector` can be used to
solve code duplication for this use case. `@AnnotationCollector` can be
specified on annotation types and acts as meta-annotation. Whenever an
annotation marked with it is found, it is replaced with its own
annotations. Let’s illustrate this with our ISBN example.

We will create a new annotation combination for the 13-digit ISBN
standard, but this time, using
the `@AnnotationCollector` meta-annotation:

[source,groovy]
-------------------------------------
@NotNull
@Length(13)
@Pattern(/\d{12}(\d|X)/)
@groovy.transform.AnnotationCollector
@interface ISBN13 {}
-------------------------------------

`@ISBN13` as a single annotation can now be applied on code elements,
instead of applying the entire annotation gang::

[source,groovy]
-----------------
class Book {
    // ...
    @ISBN13
    String isbn13
}
-----------------

What is particularly interesting with such *meta-annotations* is that
they are actually *replaced at compilation time with
the _real_ annotations*. So if you counted the number of annotations on
the `isbn13` property, you would count 3
(`@NotNull`, `@Length` and `@Pattern`). Thus, your underlying framework
doesn’t need to know about that meta-annotation solution and act
accordingly.

[[Groovy21releasenotes-Alternatenotation]]
=== Alternate notation

In our example above, we annotated our meta-annotation with the
annotations that are then combined together. But for annotations for
which you don’t need to specify arguments, you could have also passed
the names of the annotations to combine as parameters to the annotation
collector:

[source,groovy]
------------------------------------------------------------
import groovy.transform.*
@groovy.transform.AnnotationCollector([ToString, Singleton])
@interface ChattySingleton {}
------------------------------------------------------------

In the above case, we combine
the `@Singleton` and `@ToString` transformation into a meta-annotation
called `@ChattySingleton`.

[[Groovy21releasenotes-Passingparameters]]
=== Passing parameters

If you need to pass some specific parameter to one of the underlying
annotations which are combined, you can still do so by passing the
parameter to the meta-annotation.

Let’s assume we need to combine the following annotations:

[source,groovy]
-------------------------------------------
@interface Service {}

@interface Transactional {
    String propagation() default "required"
}
-------------------------------------------

We define the meta-annotation combining both the above annotations:

[source,groovy]
---------------------------------------------------------------
@groovy.transform.AnnotationCollector([Service, Transactional])
@interface TransactionalService {}
---------------------------------------------------------------

But we want to change the propagation strategy for the
underlying `@Transactional` annotation, we do so by passing the
parameter to the meta-annotation:

[source,groovy]
------------------------------------------------
@TransactionalService(propagation = "mandatory")
class BankingService { }
------------------------------------------------

Note that if two combined annotations share the same parameter name, the
last annotation declared wins and gets the parameter passed to the
meta-annotation.

[[Groovy21releasenotes-Customprocessor]]
=== Custom processor

If you need even more flexibility, meta-annotations allow you to define
custom processors. The role of the custom processor is to go beyond the
simple exchange of the meta-annotation with the combined annotations, to
further customize the logic of that transformation.

Custom processors must be precompiled to take action, so we’ll create
our processor, and then evaluate our final example with `GroovyShell`,
but first, let’s talk about the use case.

We have two validation annotations for defining a minimum and maximum
value for an integer property:

[source,groovy]
---------------------------
@interface Min {
    int value() default 0
}

@interface Max {
    int value() default 100
}
---------------------------

If we want to define a range of values, with a lower and an upper bound,
we could define a new annotation and implement the associated validation
logic, or we could use custom meta-annotation processors to replace a
range annotation with a minimum and a maximum one.

So instead of writing:

[source,groovy]
-----------------------
class Room {
    @Min(1)
    @Max(4)
    int numberOfPersons
}
-----------------------

We could write:

[source,groovy]
----------------------------
class Room {
    @Range(from = 1, to = 4)
    int numberOfPersons
}
----------------------------

With the normal replacement logic, there’s no way we can map the lower
and upper bound values to the minimum and maximum annotation element
default values. That is where custom processors come into play.

Our meta-annotation definition will look like this:

[source,groovy]
------------------------------------------------------------
@Min @Max
@AnnotationCollector(processor = 'RangeAnnotationProcessor')
@interface Range {}
------------------------------------------------------------

Notice how we specify that the `@Range` annotation is a combination
of `@Min` and `@Max`, and more importantly, how we pass a processor
parameter to the `@AnnotationCollector` to instruct it about our custom
meta-annotation processing logic.

In order to create a custom processor, you have to extend
the `AnnotationCollectorTransform` class and override
the `visit()` method:

[source,groovy]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
import org.codehaus.groovy.transform.AnnotationCollectorTransform
import org.codehaus.groovy.ast.*
import org.codehaus.groovy.control.SourceUnit

class RangeAnnotationProcessor extends AnnotationCollectorTransform {
    List<AnnotationNode> visit(AnnotationNode collector,
                               AnnotationNode usage,
                               AnnotatedNode annotated,
                               SourceUnit src) {

        def minExpr = usage.getMember('from')
        def maxExpr = usage.getMember('to')

        def (minAnno, maxAnno) = getTargetAnnotationList(collector, usage, src)

        minAnno.addMember('value', minExpr)
        maxAnno.addMember('value', maxExpr)

        usage.members.remove('from')
        usage.members.remove('to')

        return [minAnno, maxAnno]
    }
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A few words about the parameters : the `collector` corresponds to
the `@Range` annotation definition, `usage` to the actual usage of
the `@Range` annotation, `annotated` is the annotated class,
and `src` is script being compiled.

We start our implementation of the processor by retrieving the numeric
expressions of the bounds defined as the from and to annotation
parameters, because we’ll pass those values back to the
underlying `@Min` and `@Max` combined annotations. In order to do that,
we retrieve the `@Min` and `@Max` combined annotations thanks to
the `getTargetAnnotationList()` method. We then set the values of
the `@Min` and `@Max` annotations to the expressions we’ve retrieved
before. We remove the from and to bounds from
the `@Range` meta-annotation since those parameters
aren’t really defined on a real annotation but on a meta-annotation. And
last, we return the two `@Min` and `@Max` annotations. If you wanted the
Groovy compiler to do its usual replacement logic, you could have also
called `super.visit(...)`, but in our case it wasn’t needed.

The full example can be found in this Gist on
Github: https://gist.github.com/4563430

[[Groovy21releasenotes-Compilationcustomization]]
== Compilation customization

[[Groovy21releasenotes-Custombasescriptclassflag]]
=== Custom base script class flag

When integrating and evaluating Groovy scripts in an application for
business rules or Domain-Specific Languages, it is often valuable to
define a base script class, in order to add various utility methods,
properties, or interception mechanisms for missing methods or
properties.

The `CompilerConfiguration` object, that you can pass
to `GroovyShell` and other integration mechanisms, allows you to specify
a base script class with the `setScriptBaseClass()` method.

As of Groovy 2.1, we introduce the ability to define a base script class
reference for your scripts via an additional command-line option `-b` /
 `--basescript` for the `groovyc` command, as well as for
the `groovy` command.

Here’s an example using a script called `businessRule.groovy`:

[source,groovy]
-----------------------------------
assert lookupRate(EUR, USD) == 1.33
-----------------------------------

In the above script, we notice two things: the usage of
a `lookupRate()` method, and two undeclared variables: `EUR` and `USD`.
Neither the method, nor the variables have been defined in our script.
Instead, they are provided by a base script class, which can look like
the following `ExchangeRateBaseScript.groovy` class:

[source,groovy]
--------------------------------------------------------
abstract class ExchangeRateBaseScript extends Script {
    def lookupRate(String currency1, String currency2) {
        if (currency1 == 'EUR' && currency2 == 'USD')
            return 1.33
        else return 1
    }

    def getProperty(String name) { name }
}
--------------------------------------------------------

The `lookupRate()` method used in our script is declared in the the base
class, and the two currencies are retrieved via
the `getProperty()` method.

Now it’s time to wire them together, by instructing the groovyc compiler
or the `groovy` command line launcher to use our base script class for
all `groovy.lang.Script` descendants:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
groovy --basescript ExchangeRateBaseScript.groovy businessRule.groovy
---------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Groovy21releasenotes-Compilerconfigurationscript]]
=== Compiler configuration script

Similarly to the `--basescript` flag, there’s another new option for
the `groovy` and `groovyc` commands: the `--configscript` flag. Its
purpose is to let you further configure the compiler, in a configuration
script, by parameterizing the `CompilerConfiguration` object used for
the compilation.

With a `CompilerConfiguration`, you can customize the various aspects of
the Groovy compilation process. For example, you can specify various
compilation customizers introduced in Groovy 1.8. Imagine you want to
add a new default import to your classes, like importing
all `java.lang.Math` functions and constants, so that your scripts and
classes don’t have to prefix those functions and constants all the time,
and to avoid having to do that import wherever needed. Here’s how you
can proceed.

At first, your script, `mathFormula.groovy`, contains the following
lines:

[source,groovy]
------------------------------
import static java.lang.Math.*

assert sin(PI/2) == 1
------------------------------

For evaluating such math expressions, you wish to make the static import
implicit, so that the final script will actually look like this:

[source,groovy]
---------------------
assert sin(PI/2) == 1
---------------------

If you’d run it as is, you’d get an error message saying:

-------------------------------------------
No such property: PI for class: mathFormula
-------------------------------------------

We need to use `CompilerConfiguration` to do add an `ImportCustomizer`.
We’ll create ai `mportConfigurer.groovy` script with the content below:

[source,groovy]
---------------------------------------------------------------
import org.codehaus.groovy.control.customizers.ImportCustomizer

def importCustomizer = new ImportCustomizer()
importCustomizer.addStaticStar('java.lang.Math')

configuration.addCompilationCustomizers(importCustomizer)
---------------------------------------------------------------

We import and then instantiate an `ImportCustomizer`, on which we ask
for a static star import of the methods and constants of
the `java.lang.Math` class. Eventually, we pass that customizer to
the `configuration` variable, which is an instance
of `CompilerConfiguration` that will be used for the compilation of your
math formula.

Now, we are able to execute your formula with the following
command-line:

----------------------------------------------------------------
groovy --configscript importConfigurer.groovy mathFormula.groovy
----------------------------------------------------------------

[[Groovy21releasenotes-Source-awarecustomizer]]
=== Source-aware customizer

If you use the groovy compiler to compile all your classes, one drawback
of the approach above is that the customization applies globally to all
classes that are going to be compiled. You may want to add certain
default imports only in certain classes (ie. scripts containing math),
but you might want to do something different for other classes, like
adding a `@ToString` transformation to all the domain classes of your
application. For that purpose, a new customizer was created,
the `SourceAwareCustomizer`, to let you filter which classes should be
impacted by particular compilation customizations, such as filtering by
class name, by file extension, or by a custom logic.

Coming back to our previous example, let’s add the default import to
our `mathFormula.groovy` script, but add a `@ToString` transformation to
the `MyDomain.groovy` class:

[source,groovy]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
import org.codehaus.groovy.control.customizers.*
import groovy.transform.ToString

def importCustomizer = new ImportCustomizer()
importCustomizer.addStaticStar('java.lang.Math')

configuration.addCompilationCustomizers(
    new SourceAwareCustomizer(new ASTTransformationCustomizer(ToString)) {
        boolean acceptBaseName(baseName) { baseName ==~ 'MyDomain' }
    },
    new SourceAwareCustomizer(importCustomizer) {
        boolean acceptBaseName(baseName) { baseName ==~ 'mathFormula' }
    })
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Groovy21releasenotes-Compilercustomizationbuilder]]
=== Compiler customization builder

The more complex the customization becomes, the more cumbersome the
above configuration becomes to write too, that’s why Groovy 2.1 also
provides a builder for building these types of configurations.

The builder allows you to use a familiar declarative syntax and saves
you from adding manually various imports. Let’s adapt our example above
with the builder:

[source,groovy]
---------------------------------------------------------------
withConfig(configuration) {
    source(basenameValidator: { it.endsWith('MyDomain') }) {
        ast(ToString)
    }
    source(basenameValidator: { it.endsWith('mathFormula') }) {
        imports {
            staticStar 'java.lang.Math'
        }
    }
}
---------------------------------------------------------------

The configuration code is easier to read and maintain, thanks to the
clarity brought by the builder approach. But we’ve only seen a couple
examples of customization, and you should have a look at the other
customizations available in the
org.codehaus.groovy.control.customizers.builder package to learn more
about them.

== Other Minor Enhancements

[[Groovy21releasenotes-AdditionalDGMmethods]]
=== Additional DGM methods

There are now `leftShift` and `withFormatter` methods for `Appendable`
objects. +
There are now methods for creating temporary directories and determining
the total size of all files in a directory. +
There is now a `collectMany` for maps (has been backported to earlier
versions of Groovy too). +
There is now a `closeStreams()` method for `Process` objects.

[[Groovy21releasenotes-GroovyDoc]]
=== GroovyDoc

You can now explicitly set a file encoding.

[[Groovy21releasenotes-Command-line]]
=== Command-line

There is support for using a `jar:` prefix when running a script from
a URL, in addition to the `file:` and `http:`.

[[Groovy21releasenotes-XMLProcessing]]
=== XML Processing

There is a method for escaping / encoding XML entities in Strings. +
There is a convenience method for serializing `Elements` objects.  +
You can now clone `Node` and `NodeList` objects.  +
The name() method now works for all `Node` objects, not just `Element`
objects. 

[[Groovy21releasenotes-ConfigSlurper]]
=== ConfigSlurper

Multiple environments blocks are now supported and merged.

[[Groovy21releasenotes-Delegate]]
=== @Delegate

Can now carry over annotations if desired for methods and method
parameters.

[[Groovy21releasenotes-ToString]]
=== @ToString

You can now cache the `toString` value. This is useful for immutable
objects.

[[Groovy21releasenotes-EqualsAndHashCode]]
=== @EqualsAndHashCode

You can now cache the calculated hashCode value. This is useful for
immutable objects.

[[Groovy21releasenotes-Immutable]]
=== @Immutable

You can now specify `knownImmutables`. This is useful when you know you
are using an immutable object, but its type isn’t one of the known
immutable types.

[[Groovy21releasenotes-AutoClone]]
=== @AutoClone

There is now a `SIMPLE` `AutoCloneStyle` which avoids some annoyances
with Java’s cloning behavior from `Object`. Those who need to clone
Grails domain objects might find this useful.
